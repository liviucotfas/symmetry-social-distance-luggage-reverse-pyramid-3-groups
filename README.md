## Boarding Scenarios

All the simulations have been performed using the following settings:
- occupancy level: 100% (120 passengers).

> Suggestion: You can download the animations below in order to watch them at a higher resolution.

### 1. Social distancing: 1.0m; Luggage situation: S1; g1 = 25, g2a = 24 (G1 = 50, G2 = 58, G3 = 12)
